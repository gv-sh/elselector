# Parallel Line Generator

This Python script generates and visualizes parallel lines within a specified square area. It includes functions to calculate line coordinates and draw the resulting image.

## Features

- Generate parallel lines with a specified slope and interdistance
- Visualize the lines within a square boundary
- Save the generated image as a PNG file

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the `elselector.py` file.
2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```
   python elselector.py
   ```

2. The script will generate a square image with parallel lines and save it as `parallel_lines.png`.

## Customization

You can customize the following parameters:

- `x_min`, `x_max`, `y_min`, `y_max`: The boundaries of the square area.
- `m`: The slope of the lines.
- `h`: The interdistance between the lines.

You can modify these parameters to generate different sets of parallel lines.
